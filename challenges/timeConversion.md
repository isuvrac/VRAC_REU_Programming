1. Declare a variable to store the number of seconds.
2. Use cin to get the number of seconds from the user and store it in the variable.  
3. Convert the number of seconds to hours using the following formula:

## Going Further (optional)
Instead of converting seconds to hours, convert seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, if the user inputs 7645, the program should output 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 25 seconds.
